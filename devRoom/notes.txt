sorry this isnt an md file i dont feel like formatting that rn

anyway, in the branch titled: cleanUp I have done the following as of the commit titled: []

1. I began combining rooms with collision with krill movement into a single file called devRoom, 
    
2. in devRoom as of 12:58 am on 3/12/24 the krill moves smoothly in 4 directions with the wasd/arrow controls, 
   rotation is taken care of 

3. the up to date wall tileSheet was redesigned to be 16x16 tiles so the collision is closer to the actual tile 
   borders

4. in addition to the devRoom folder with working wall collision and krill movement, I also moved some old files/
   folders into a folder titled "oldStuff"
   - once the slowDown tiles are implemented in devRoom, krillMovemnet and RoomWithCollision can be moved there 
   as well

It is my intention with devRoom that new feature branches can be built and implemented in dev room so each branch 
can have a good foundational starting point for krill controls and walls with collisons

sorry this is so poorly written IDK how it got this late
